# About me

I am a physicist, born in a small city in Brazil named Eloi Mendes in the state of Minas Gerais (land of the best food - the "pao de queijo"). I am an experienced data analytics manager with a strong track record of driving data-driven decision-making across various industries, in special marketing analytics (tracking customer engagement and feedback, optimizing media/advertising campaigns to maximize ROI, personalizing the customer experience and improving customer retention). In the last 10+ years, I have developed a deep understanding of the role of data in creating business value.

In addition to my work in various industries, I am particularly interested in the use of data analytics across a wide range of context, from gaming and sports as hobbies or to drive positive outcomes in many areas, including healthcare, education, public policy, and more. I have a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities that come with any data framework, and I have experience working that will allow me to transfer my skills to implement data-driven strategies and make a meaningful impact on the world around us.

Powered by LinkedIn Learning Champion Program at the end of my "Data Analytics for Business Decision Making" program, I wrote a series of posts aimed at sharing my perspective on data analytics and data science, presenting fundamental concepts, introducing people to the world of data, and discussing some practical use cases.
